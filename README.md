# DVD-Rental-Revenue-Analysis-Balancing-Morality-and-Profitability
A SQL project exploring how business decisions around film ratings can impact rental revenue. Built using PostgreSQL and the publicly available DVD Rental sample database.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes rental revenue patterns using the [PostgreSQL DVD Rental sample database](https://neon.com/postgresql/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database). The queries and business logic were written by me to simulate a real-world scenario: how a company might adjust its inventory to favor family-friendly films while maintaining profitability.

---

## Installation

- The database is formatted for **PostgreSQL**
- Queries are written in **PostgreSQL dialect**
- You may attempt to adapt the code for other DBMSs (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server), but compatibility is not guaranteed
